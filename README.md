# Hello!
I am a 'to be' programmer currently about to enter my last year of secondary school

I have alot of experience in python, and can use C++ to a lower degree

I enjoy doing some, mostly useless, but complex and mathematical projects in my free time. The most interesting of such I will publish here.
